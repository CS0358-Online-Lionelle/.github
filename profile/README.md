# Syllabus - CS 0359 Foundations of Algorithms and Data Structures 


Explores foundational computer science concepts essential for graduate level coursework. Examines discrete mathematics principles, including probabilities and combinations, along with proof techniques such as induction. Addresses various algorithmic approaches including quadratic and divide-and-conquer sorting methods. Investigates data structures such as sequences, trees, graphs, and hashtables and introduces research methodologies relevant to computer science and related disciplines.

## Performance-Based Admissions
CS 0359 is a self-paced module that focuses on demonstrating competency in introductory algorithms and data structures. By completing this course, you demonstrate that through a combination of previous experience *and* completing a detailed portfolio, you have the skill set needed to be successful in an MSCS program with Khoury College of Computer Sciences. It is important to note that completing the course does not guarantee admission (as other factors are often taken into account), but it provides evidence of prior learning and knowledge to improve your admission prospects.

## Prerequisites  
While there are no direct course prerequisites, it is assumed that students entering the course have the following backgrounds:

* Prior programming experience through bootcamps, self-taught knowledge, or on-the-job experience
* Previous bachelor's degree in any field
* Strong work ethic and motivation for self-paced learning using a variety of resources

## Self-Paced / Competency Pathway vs. Align Pathway
This course focuses on students developing a portfolio to demonstrate learning and understanding of key topics. Resources are provided to help students gain the understanding necessary for demonstrating their knowledge, and students are encouraged to find additional resources as needed. This course is designed for people who already have practical knowledge, but lack the theoretical and foundational knowledge needed to be successful in the MSCS.

It is worth noting that if you don't have a programming background and/or you are looking for a more guided sequence with traditional assignments and courses, you may want to explore the [Align Program](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/align-masters-of-science-in-computer-science/). This is a high-contact, high-support program focused on guiding non-computer scientists to be successful in the MSCS.

## Outcomes and Topics

By the end of the course, students should demonstrate an understanding of both theory and implementation of the following topics:

* Understand, discuss, and apply mathematical foundations for computer science
  * Number representation (binary, conversion, modular arithmetic)
  * Collections and sets
  * Methods of proof
  * Combinatorics and permutations
  * Probability
  * Series
  * Big O and growth of functions
  * Graph theory
* Sorting data with quadratic and divide-and-conquer sorts
* Analyze and implement fundamental data structures
  * Vectors
  * Linked lists
  * Binary trees
  * Heaps
  * Hash tables
  * Graphs
* Describe the foundations of of greedy algorithms
  * Implement Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
* Describe trade-offs between data structures given context
* Implement programs utilizing the best data structure for the given context
* Analyze empirically and theoretically new data structures and algorithms
  
## Course Schedule
As the course is self-paced, the primary focus is on the final portfolio and technical interview. However, due to Northeastern deadlines, the course *must* be completed at least 15 days before one of the admission deadlines (ideally sooner). This allows students the opportunity to apply for the program and ensures systems are updated to reflect course completion. If you miss the deadline, you will roll to the next deadline.

| Target Semester | Khoury Admissions Deadline |  Technical Interview **Completion** Deadline | Portfolio Submission Deadline |
| :-------------: | :------------------------: |  :-----------------------------------------: | :--------------------------:  |
|    Fall         |      May 1                 |                  April 15                    |          April 1              |
|  Spring <br /> (international students) | October 1     |        September 15               |          September 1          |
|  Spring <br /> (domestic students)      | December 1    |        November 15                |          November 1           |

For many students starting CS 0359 in the fall, this will mean targeting a start semester of the following fall—so Fall 2025 starts will be targeting a Fall 2026 start date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should not wait until the deadlines to submit, especially when your portfolio. If your portfolio gets returned with
> suggested updates and changes, this may mean you will miss the next deadline. Early completion is recommended.
